      Instructions:

      The agenda, week, and month views can be accessed from the main page of the app.

      Month View:
          Click on a date to see all events on that date. Add an event to a particular date
          by clicking the "Add Event" button after selecting the desired date.

          Events can be edited or deleted by clicking on them in the list under the calendar
          view. Any changes will be reflected immediately.

          Navigate through months with the "Prev" and "Next" buttons on the top.

          Day View:
              To see the events for a day in an hourly format, click the text in the month
              view that says (for example) "Events on 1 December 2018". This is under the calendar
              and above the event list.

              Events can be edited or deleted by clicking on them. Any changes will not appear
              immediately (exit/reenter), and there are edge cases that may cause crashes.

      Week View:
          Events can be edited or deleted by clicking on them. Any changes will not appear
          immediately (exit/reenter), and there are edge cases that may cause crashes.

          Navigate through weeks with the "Prev" and "Next" buttons on the top.

      Agenda View:
          This view shows all events from the current instant in time forward, sorted
          chronologically.

          Events can be edited or deleted by clicking on them. Any changes will be reflected
          immediately.
